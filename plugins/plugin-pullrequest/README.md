plugin-contribution
===================

This plugin handles two sides on the contribution to a project inside Che:

- Contribution: eases the submission of a contribution by a developer by automating many tasks. The clone and checkout
  tasks are handled at the beginning of the process while the push and pull request submission are handled at the end.

- Review: The Contribution side ends with the generation of a factory that will help the reviewer to decide and merge
or reject the contribution.
